OOP based functionality for JavaScript and Node.js. This is merely a fun prototype (get it?) in regards to extending the DOM and the JS prototype to it's full potential.
Since extending the DOM is frowned upon because of legacy issues, this project will only support the most modern of browsers... and again, it's for fun.

[Joop is loosely based on this wonderful article.](http://perfectionkills.com/whats-wrong-with-extending-the-dom)

This project is basically the bastard love child of jQuery, MooTools and Prototype. Big thanks to those libraries for any code I have borrowed or based from.
